## Usage in AI Agents

Agent thinking:
1. Call get_policy_summary to understand available discounts
2. Present options based on the rules

Agent: "Our pricing policy offers the following discount structure:

• Base discount: Up to 10% on standard orders
• Volume discount: Up to 15% on orders of 100+ units
• Maximum cap: 25% is our ceiling regardless of order size

To maximize your discount, consider ordering 100+ units.
Would you like me to calculate the best price for a specific quantity?"
